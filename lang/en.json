  "job1-role": "Development and maintenance of corporate website",
  "job1-desc1": "The project's website was poorly ranked in search engines, which limited the influx of new users. I conducted an audit and, based on the best SEO practices, completely redesigned the HTML structure of key pages, implemented semantic markup and improved meta tags. This led to a ~35% increase in organic traffic in the first three months and a significant improvement in Lighthouse's performance (Performance: 92, SEO: 95).",

  "job2-role": "Development and optimization of internal company services",
  "job2-desc1": "There was no unified data access system between the internal services, which made analytics difficult and decision-making slower. He designed and implemented a REST API for consolidating data from multiple systems, and standardized data formats for subsequent analysis. Accelerated access to data for analytical and operational teams, reducing system response time by 25%.",
  "job2-desc2": "Analytical reporting was based on heavy SQL queries that ran for more than 30 seconds and blocked the work of analysts. Optimized analytical SQL queries (indexes, refactoring, connection pooling), analyzed execution plans. Reduced the execution time of reporting queries by 2 times, which allowed analysts to receive data without delay.",
